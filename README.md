# Dreadline

A simple text editor with a twist: you can't save your work. Choose your manager/coworker/editor email address and the deadline, and when the deadline is up, puff. The text disappears and the email is ready to be sent.

No more procrastination

## Getting Started

The code runs in XCode without much hassle. Soon we'll improve the UI and launch it to the Mac App Store.
